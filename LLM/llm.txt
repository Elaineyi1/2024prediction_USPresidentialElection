If my writing is already good and natural, do not improve it to a fancy thing: The dominance of only two political parties in the current US political system adds an extra layer of competitiveness and interest to the presidential election. This paper uses multilevel regression with post-stratification to predict the outcome between the two candidates, Biden and Trump. The model, along with the post-stratification, indicates that Biden is going to secure a substantial lead of at least 10% in popular votes, suggesting a strong likelihood that the US will continue on a democratic pathway.

The forthcoming 2024 United States presidential election, scheduled for Tuesday, November 5 [@270towin270toWin2024], 2024, will see US citizens electing to determine the nation’s president and vice president, shaping the pathways of the country for the next four years. The current president Joe Biden, a member of the Democratic Party, is running for re-election, and his predecessor, Donald Trump from the Republican Party, is running for re-election for a nonconsecutive term. Throughout campaigns, political parties articulate their stances and future policies on broader issues such as abortion, immigration, safety, and LGBTQ+ rights. The Democratic and Republican parties typically hold distinct yet steadfast viewpoints, attracting a significant number of supporters among US citizens. However, the post-COVID era has brought about significant changes economically, socially, and politically, making it particularly intriguing to see how these shifts will influence the upcoming 60th quadrennial presidential election.

I will use multilevel regression with post-stratification (MRP) to model and then predict whether Biden or Trump will win the popular votes, which is the total number of votes cast by individual citizens. MRP in this paper involves collecting individual-level survey data from the Polarization research Lab, analyzing the proportion of support among different demographical groups, and applying the proportion to a larger census dataset from the IPUMS USA, 2022 American Community Survey. One thing that needs to be pointed out is that rather than just depending on the popular votes, the United States elects its president though electoral college. The 51 states are allocated 538 electoral-college votes. The numbers of votes granted to each state, which are different, depend on its representation in the Senate and House of Representatives, and usually every state gives all of its electoral-college votes to whomever wins the popular vote in that state [@economistDoesAmericas]. In other words, it is possible that one candidate wins the popular vote, which represents the collective choice of voters, but lose the presidential election because of the distribution of electoral college votes, like the election in 2016 where Hillary Clinton won the popular votes (48%) while losing the election due to the states that support her have fewer electoral college votes than the ones support Trump [@nytimes2016Presidential]. 

In this paper, I will only predict the popular votes for two candidates, Joe Biden and Donald Trump, utilizing predictors as follow: race, gender, age group, highest level of education, the state of residence. Two datasets will be generated from the survey data —— one being simply cleaned and the other cleaned and balanced. The latter involves adjusting the survey respondents’ votes in 2020 to align with the actual 2020 results while keeping other characteristics the same. Since the balanced dataset has fewer observations than the unbalanced one, this paper focuses on the unbalanced dataset to avoid potential sampling biases. Using the unbalanced dataset, my prediction suggests that Joe Biden is poised to win 62.96% of the popular votes, and 57.61% using the balanced one. Both percentages indicates that Biden is going to secure a minimum 10% lead in the popular votes, which is a pretty large lead in election history.

This paper use the programming language R [@r]. The analysis, the model and the visualizations use the following packages: ipumsr [@ipumsr], dplyr [@rdplyr], readr [@rreadr], tidyr [@rtidyr], arrow [@rarrow], ggplot2 [@rggplot2], knitr [@rknitr], statebins [@rstatebins], modelsummary [@rmodelsummary], broom [@rbroom], here [@rhere], and kableExtra [@r kableExtra].


In this paper, I will delve into the data utilized for analysis, encompassing both survey and census data, in the upcoming section. Following that, I will introduce the model designed to generalize patterns and forecast election outcomes. I will also talk about the predicted results derived from the model. Lastly, I will discuss the results in a broader context and address weaknesses of this paper as well as the future exploration.

The survey data I use is the America’s Political Pulse Survey from the Polarization Research Lab. This open-access online survey contains a series of core questions on politics and special questions designed by political science researchers, asking a thousand Americans every week. All the respondents, the population, are paid survey takers from the YouGov survey platform. It collects demographic information, party each respondent support, and core questions like Democrat/Republican thermometer or pride in being American.

The datasets are available weekly. For this paper, I choose 20 weeks of data, the twenty weeks from October 6th, 2023 to February 23rd, 2024, forming a dataset with 20000 observations and 69 variables. The variable ‘pid3’ shows the answers to ‘Generally speaking, do you think of yourself as a…?’, and the answers could be Democratic, Republican or Independent. For this paper, I will use this variable as supporting Democratic Party/Biden or Republican Party/Trump for analysis. 

In order to predict the 2024 presidential election result using several factor, I first need to choose variables that can effectively distinguish Democrat and Republican to some extent. The survey dataset results shows that females tend to support Democracy more than males, with 63.9% female and 58.2% male respondents supporting Democracy. People with higher levels of education tend to support Democracy, especially those who completed post-graduate. 55.1% high school graduate and 60.1% people with no high school support Democracy, while 72.8% post-grads support Democracy. More widowed and married people consider themselves as Republican, while more people that are divorced, never married and separated consider themselves as Democrat. Different ethnicity people have different preference as well. Around 74.8% asians and 79.7% African Americans support Biden, compared to 55.7% white people. Additionally, since the presidential election is voted by state, I would choose race, gender, marital status, highest level of education and state of residence as the variables to explain the binary of support for Biden.

The voter turnout rates for different age groups are different. Most of the time, the turnout rate among 60+ years old are the highest, followed by people between 45 to 59 but this is still about 10% higher than the rate among 30-44 years old, and the people from 18 to 29 years have the lowest rate of voting for the past 30 years [@ourworldindataElectionVoter]. Hence, I will also use age groups as another factor that affects the popular vote outcome, and the grouping is 18-29, 30-44, 45-59, 60+.

About 22% of individuals identifying with both the Democratic and Republican parties consider voting is important, and a significant 70% from each party consider it very important. In this survey, both Democrats and Republicans exhibit similar perceptions of voting importance, indicating that the survey doesn't inaccurately estimate voting due to differing levels of importance attached to it by the parties. For all the Republican respondents, 55.7% are extremely proud to be Americans, 27.7% are very proud, while only 1.4% are not proud. For all the Democrat respondents, 33.3% are extremely proud, 25.5 are very proud, and 7.3% are not at all proud. Republicans seem to be more polarized as 52.5 of them consider themselves as MAGA Republican. 22.9% of Democrats thinks they are very liberal, 36.1% are liberal, while 27.65% of Republicans consider themselves as very conservative, 44.0% are conservative. There are also significant differences in religion beliefs. 80% of Republican think religion is important in their lives (54% very important, 26% somewhat important), while 54.8% Democrats see it as important (31.1% very important, 23.7 % somewhat). Half of the Republican respondents think they are “born-again”, or evangelical Christian, while only 26.5% Democrats think so. 38.3% Democrat are ‘Agnostic’, ‘Atheist’, or ‘Nothing in particular’, 47.6% are ‘Protestant’ or ‘Roman Catholic’. However, only 17.2% Republican are ‘Agnostic’, ‘Atheist’, or ‘Nothing in particular’, 71.2% are ‘Protestant’ or ‘Roman Catholic’. Since religion is not collected in the census data, I will not use this factor.

IPUMS USA is a website that contains decennial census from 1790 to 2010, and survey data from the American Community Surveys (ACS) and the Puerto Rican Community Surveys from 2000 to the present. The annual ACS public-use samples provided usually include housing data, demographic data, economic data and some other individual characteristics. I will use the most recent American Community Survey, which is the 2022 Sample, as the post-stratification dataset to represent the voter population and adjust the weight of the survey data. This weighted survey used cluster sampling to obtain 1-in-100 national random sample of the population. The population for this sample was the whole US population, and the population was categorized into households as subgroups and the sampled subgroups’ responses were collected. 

ACS 2022 dataset has 3,373,378 observations, making it a large and relatively representative dataset. The variables I select are STATEICP (ICPSR codes of states), SEX, AGE, MARST (marital status), RACE and EDUC (highest level of education) to match with the survey data variables I choose. I then clean and rename the variables to maintain unity with the survey data. [@fig-demographics1] and [@fig-demographics2] shows the voters’ demographics in both survey data (pre-strat) and census data (post-strat), with solid lines representing the post-stratification data and dotted lines representing the survey data. The differences in two lines are due to weight adjustment. Some obvious adjustment in [@fig-demographics1] are that there are more people from 30 to 44, more females, fewer married people, fewer asians and more African American completing the survey. [@fig-demographics2] classifies people based on education and state of residence. There are more people from Florida, New York and Texas in the survey, while states like Wyoming have very few participants, causing potential bias. 

[@fig-survey_vote] shows the proportion of support for both parties among the survey respondents. 61% support the Democratic Party, 39% support the Republican Party. This ratio is not accurate compared to the actual ratio. To further visualize it, [@fig-sample_map] uses a gradient colour scale to present the US map of support by state, with blue representing supporting Biden, and red representing supporting Trump. States like Wyoming (WY), Kansas (KS), Nebraska (NE) and Alabama (AL) are blue in [@fig-sample_map] while they are reliably red states in recent decades [@pewresearchReligiousLandscape]. Therefore, to adjust this sample bias, I also create a balanced survey dataset.

Among the respondents in the survey, those who voted for Biden in 2020 (44.7%) were approximately 1.5 times as many as those who voted for Trump (30.7%) as shown in [@tbl-survey_votes_2020]. This difference is substantial when compared to the actual popular vote ratio in 2020, which is 51.3%:46.9% [@cookpolitical2020Popular]. I adjust the survey ratio of 2020 votes to match the actual 51.3%:46.9% ratio to create a balanced dataset. To be more specific, I keep all the observations that support Trump in 2020 but randomly select the a certain number of observations that support Biden in 2020. The number of rows selected is determined by the floor value of 51.3/46.9*(the number of rows that supported Trump). 

The limitation of this method is that the balanced sample is smaller than the unbalanced sample, causing potential biases and underrepresentation may appear for some groups. The strength is that the balanced dataset contains a more reasonable rather than a disparate proportion of supporters for the two parties. [@fig-balanced_two_compare] (a) shows 3851 respondents consider themselves as Republicans, and 4650 respondents consider themselves as Democrats. [@fig-balanced_two_compare] (b) indicates 3896 people voted for Trump and 4605 voted for Biden in the last election.

The data creating [@fig-actual_survey_compare] (a) is a US Election 2020 dataset from Kaggle, which contains county-level data from 2020 US Election including votes, candidates and whether each candidate wins the election. [@fig-actual_survey_compare] shows two maps, one presents the 2020 actual voting results and one depicts the 2020 voting results from the balanced survey. The distribution of votes from the balanced dataset is more accurate. Alabama (AL) is red in [@fig-actual_survey_compare], Kansas (KS) and Nebraska (NE) are not as blue as in [@fig-sample_map]. I will use the ACS dataset to adjust the proportion of population as well. A prediction map using the balance dataset will be included at the end of the Results section.

To predict the 2024 election result, I will use Multilevel Regression with Post-Stratification (MRP), which is a statistical technique that combines the strengths of multilevel modelling and post-stratification. MRP takes a sample, usually a large-scale poll, and uses the poll results to generate a model. After that, this model is applied to a post-stratification dataset, typically a census or other larger sample [@tellingstorieswithdataTellingStories]. In this paper, the sample is the America’s Political Pulse dataset, and the census is the IPUMS ACS dataset. Logistic regression will be used to create the model.

One thing that needs to be pointed out is that, if we had perfect data, we would not need a model [@tellingstorieswithdataTellingStories]. Model aims to generalize patterns from the data and make predictions, so MRP is not guaranteed to provide perfect accuracy. I assume there exists a relationship between predictors, which are race, gender, marital status, age group and highest level of education, and the voting outcome, and this relationship is steady between the sample and the post-stratification dataset. Therefore, model is not perfectly flawless, and given that the accuracy of MRP depends on the accuracy of the model, uncertainties and imprecision are inevitable.

Logistic regression is very useful when dealing with a binary outcome variable. Hence, Instead of using ‘pid3’ variable in the survey dataset, which gives either ‘Democrat’ or ‘Republican’, I create a new variable named ‘vote_biden’. In this new setup, ‘vote_biden’ will be assigned a value of 1 if ‘pid3' is Democrat and 0 if ‘pid3’ is Republican. For instance, if the average "vote_biden" equals to 0.5, then half of the population supports Biden.

The logistic regression equation for predicting the binary outcome of support for Biden (where 1 indicates support) can be expressed as follow:

I use the binomial distribution to model the probability of the binary outcome in the survey. [@tbl-coefficients] shows the estimates for the coefficients that will fit into the logistic regression equation, as well as the standard error, statistic, p-value, the 95% confidence level for each coefficient. Statistic is the t-statistic for testing whether the corresponding coefficient is significantly different from zero. A 95% confidence level means that if I were to repeat the sampling and estimation so many times, I would expect the true value of the coefficient to fall within this interval in approximately 95% repetitions. The ‘state’ variable has relatively larger p-values and standard errors when compared to other predictors in [@tbl-coefficients]. Terms like ‘statenameNorth Dakota’, ‘statenameSouth Dakota’, ‘statenameWest Virginia’ and ‘maritalSeparated’ have p-values greater than 0.8, implying their evidences against the null hypothesis is weak. The greater the estimate, the higher the likelihood that people with these characteristics will vote for Biden.

[@fig-coefficients_model] visualizes the estimates of coefficients as black dots and the confidence intervals as blue lines from a logistic regression model. The length of each blue line (error bar) reflects the confidence interval for the corresponding coefficient. The zero on the x-axis denotes neutrality. For example, an estimate of -0.1 implies a slight inclination toward voting for Trump. Most data points in [@fig-coefficients_model] are situated to the right of the zero on the x-axis, indicating a higher inclination toward supporting Biden. The further to the right both the points and blue lines extend, the greater the likelihood that individuals with these characteristics will vote for Biden. Conversely, points and lines extending to the left suggest a higher probability of supporting Trump. From [@fig-coefficients_model], a person from the District of Columbia is most likely to support Biden, a person from Alaska is most likely to support Trump, and someone who is separated is swing and unpredictable.

After constructing a model, I categorize individuals in both survey and census datasets according to their race, age, gender, marital status, and education level. I compute both the total count and the proportion for each group. Next, utilizing the survey data, I calculate the proportion of voters that tend to support Biden within each demographic group including the confidence intervals, and apply this proportion to the census dataset for weight adjustment, ensuring a more representative population composition.

I use the binomial distribution to model the probability of the binary outcome in the survey. [@tbl-coefficients] shows the estimates for the coefficients that will fit into the logistic regression equation, as well as the standard error, statistic, p-value, and the 95% confidence level for each coefficient. The statistic is the t-statistic for testing whether the corresponding coefficient is significantly different from zero. A 95% confidence level means that if I were to repeat the sampling and estimation many times, I would expect the true value of the coefficient to fall within this interval in approximately 95% of repetitions. The ‘state’ variable has relatively larger p-values and standard errors when compared to other predictors in [@tbl-coefficients]. Terms like ‘statenameNorth Dakota’, ‘statenameSouth Dakota’, ‘statenameWest Virginia’, and ‘maritalSeparated’ have p-values greater than 0.8, implying their evidence against the null hypothesis is weak. The greater the estimate, the higher the likelihood that people with these characteristics will vote for Biden.

[@fig-coefficients_model] visualizes the estimates of coefficients as black dots and the confidence intervals as blue lines from a logistic regression model. The length of each blue line (error bar) reflects the confidence interval for the corresponding coefficient. The zero on the x-axis denotes neutrality. For example, an estimate of -0.1 implies a slight inclination toward voting for Trump. Most data points in [@fig-coefficients_model] are situated to the right of the zero on the x-axis, indicating a higher inclination toward supporting Biden. The further to the right both the points and blue lines extend, the greater the likelihood that individuals with these characteristics will vote for Biden. Conversely, points and lines extending to the left suggest a higher probability of supporting Trump. From [@fig-coefficients_model], a person from the District of Columbia is most likely to support Biden, a person from Alaska is most likely to support Trump, and someone who is separated is swing and unpredictable.

how to add a short sentence after 'implying their evidence against the null hypothesis is weak' to explain this to people who do not know statistics

ChatGPT
"Terms like 'statenameNorth Dakota,' 'statenameSouth Dakota,' 'statenameWest Virginia,' and 'maritalSeparated' have p-values greater than 0.8, implying their evidence against the null hypothesis is weak. In simpler terms, this suggests that these characteristics may not strongly influence the likelihood of individuals supporting Biden, as the statistical evidence supporting such an influence is not particularly strong."

[@fig-sample_and_population] shows the proportion of voters in each state that vote for Biden after post-stratify. The red points represent the percentage of voting for Biden from the survey data. The black points represent the predicted voting percentage based on the model generated from the survey, in other words, the black points are post-stratified. A solid black line and a dashed red line are constructed to connect the points from the corresponding data source to better visualize the fluctuations. The purple ribbon is the range of potential outcomes or variations around the predicted values. This visual representation of the possible deviations uses the 95% confidence interval. Additionally, there is a purple line that represents 50%. The points above this line, like Wisconsin and Massachusetts, have more people supporting Biden. The points below this line, including Utah and Montana, are the states with more residents voting for Trump. States like Minnesota, where the voting percentage hovers around 50%, and the confidence interval spans both above and below the purple line, are commonly referred to as swing states. Overall, the predicted outcomes are pretty close to the survey. With the unbalanced dataset, it appears that a greater number of states favour Biden over Trump. Based on this observation, I predict that Biden will establish a comfortable lead in the popular votes in the upcoming Presidential Election.

[@fig-population_map] is a state bin plot of the predicted support for Joe Biden and Donald Trump by states using a gradient colour scale. The colour intensity indicates the level of support. The redder a state appears, the higher the predicted proportion of support for Trump. The bluer a state is, the higher the predicted proportion of support for Biden. Again, it appears that a greater number of states prefer Biden over Trump, with 62.96% supporting Biden.

[@fig-sample_and_population] illustrates the proportion of voters in each state supporting Biden after post-stratification. The red points represent the actual percentage of voting for Biden from the survey data. The black points depict the predicted voting percentage based on the model generated from the survey, essentially representing the post-stratified values. To enhance clarity, solid black lines connect the points from the corresponding data source, while dashed red lines connect the survey data points. A purple ribbon, denoting the range of potential outcomes or variations around the predicted values, is included. This visual representation of possible deviations employs the 95% confidence interval. Additionally, a purple line at 50% serves as a reference. States with points above this line, such as Wisconsin and Massachusetts, indicate more people supporting Biden, while states below the line, including Utah and Montana, have more residents voting for Trump. States like Minnesota, where the voting percentage hovers around 50% and the confidence interval spans both above and below the purple line, are commonly referred to as swing states. Overall, the predicted outcomes closely align with the survey results. With the unbalanced dataset, it appears that a greater number of states favor Biden over Trump. Based on this observation, I predict that Biden will establish a comfortable lead in the popular votes in the upcoming Presidential Election.

[@fig-population_map] presents a state bin plot of the predicted support for Joe Biden and Donald Trump by states, using a gradient color scale.

Similar to the summary of [@fig-coefficients_model], I use the balanced dataset, along with the logistic regression and Equation~\ref{eq:logit1}, to create another model, and [@fig-coefficients_model2] is the estimates of coefficients. Black points are estimates, the orange lines are confidence intervals, and the zero on the x-axis stands for neutrality. The length of each orange line reflects the confidence interval for the each coefficient. In [@fig-coefficients_model2], New Hampshire and District of Columbia have the most citizens supporting Biden, while white people and married people are most likely to support Trump. 

[@fig-sample_and_population_20] is result using MRP showing the proportion of voters in each state voting for Biden. Black represents population prediction and red represents the survey. The orange ribbon shows the range of potential variations around the predicted values using a 95% confidence interval. Compared to [@fig-sample_and_population], [@fig-sample_and_population_20] is more balanced and reasonable, as it presents comparable numbers of states that are above and below the orange line, which represents a 50% support for Biden. The predicted outcomes are close to the survey as well. States like Georgia, Texas, Nebraska turn red in @fig-sample_and_population_20], and they have traditionally been Republican-leaning states. 

[@fig-balanced_map] is a map of the US, using colours to show the predicted support. The redder a state appears, the higher the predicted proportion of support for Trump. The bluer a state is, the higher the predicted proportion of support for Biden. There are 23 red states and 28 blue states, but still, 57.61% of the population will vote for Biden which is more than half. I predict that Biden will win the popular votes.

As noted in the introduction, the outcome of the presidential election depends on electoral college votes, and unexpected outcome, like the election in 2016, may occur. Whether using the balanced or unbalanced datasets, both suggest a substantial lead for Biden in popular votes, surpassing 10%. This significant advantage makes it highly likely for him to secure more electoral college votes and thus, ensuring his re-election as the President of the United States.

Geography, Ethnicity and Gender
Based on both [@fig-population_map] and [@fig-balanced_map], states that supports Trump are more concentrated in the middle and Midwest parts of the US, whereas coastal states and the Northeast tend to favour Biden. Although Republicans and Democrats currently appear competitive, this wasn't the case thirty years ago. In the 1980, 1984, and 1988 presidential elections, the Republican Party was strongly favoured, with a maximum of 11 out of 51 states supporting the Democratic Party. However, a massive change occurred in 1992 when 33 states gave their electoral college votes to the Democratic Party, including influential states like California with 54 votes and New York with 28 votes. Since then, the two parties have been competitive, solidifying the pattern of the Midwest preferring the Republicans and coastal states leaning towards the Democrats [@270towin270toWin2024]. 

The shift in voting patterns during the 1990s, in addition to Bill Clinton's successful presentations, can be attributed to the rising number of immigrants during that period. There was a rapid increase in the number of immigrants because of immigration act of 1990 in the 1990s [@justice], while [@tbl-coefficients] has demonstrated a preference for the Democratic Party among Asians and other racial groups over white individuals. Furthermore, nowadays, blue states have more Asians and people in other race [@worldpopulationreviewStatesRace]. For example, 14.83% of the blue state California population are Asian, 22.23% are other races, while only 2.37% of the residences in Indiana are Asians and 5.67% are other races [@worldpopulationreviewStatesRace]. 

The Democrats are the liberal political party, with an emphasis in civil rights, safety issues and student loan forgiveness [@studentaid]. The Republicans are the conservative party, which is also known as the Grand Old Party. It has stood for lower taxes, broader issues and gun rights. 

The geographic distribution of red states along the southern border, as illustrated in [@fig-population_map] and [@fig-balanced_map], is noteworthy. This alignment could be linked to Republicans addressing broader issues. Furthermore, Trump's emphasis on improving the economy in the Midwest, where states traditionally lean Republican, provides another explanation for their preference for Trump compared to wealthier coastal states. This may also be correlated to the rural and suburban demographics.

In terms of abortion rights, women’s rights, and LGBTQ+ rights, the Democratic Party typically embraces more progressive positions, advocating for gender and LGBTQ+ equality to a greater extent. Conversely, the Republican Party tends to have more conservative stances on social issues, advocating for restrictions on abortion and often holding a more conservative stance on LGBTQ+ rights. As a result of these differing policy positions, there is a tendency for females to show greater support for Democratic candidates, such as Biden, compared to their male counterparts as shown in [@tbl-coefficients].

It is essential to note that these are generalizations. Individual political preferences can vary significantly within each demographic group.

Age, Education and Marital Status
Using [@tbl-coefficients], we observe that a trend where a higher proportion of younger individuals express support for Biden, while the older generation tends to favour Trump. This difference could be attributed to the younger generation's emphasis on issues like social justice and LGBTQ+ rights. Given there are definitely more sexual minorities among the youth, there is a tendency towards alignment with the Democratic Party and Biden. On the other hand, the older generation may be influenced by considerations related to national security and conservative values, which are often associated with the Republican Party. [@tbl-coefficients] also shows people with higher level of education favour Biden more often than people with lower level of education. Higher-educated individuals may prioritize issues such as environmental policies, healthcare, social justice, and education, where Democratic policies often align. Considering Biden's proposed student debt relief plan, which aims to offer targeted debt relief to low- and middle-income families, voters with a strong concern for education may find themselves inclined to support Biden. Widowed and married people, compared to single and separated individuals, prefer Trump is also observed in [@tbl-coefficients]. This can be influenced by several factors including higher average age of widowed and married individuals compared to the single ones. Additionally, some single individuals that consciously choose not to marry are more likely to be untraditional.

Again, it is crucial to acknowledge that these are generalizations, and individual political preferences can vary significantly.


Biases and Weaknesses
The sample survey was collected using participants from the YouGov panel, which may not be representative of the entire population, as not everyone has equal access to or participation in online surveys. This could lead to underrepresentation of certain demographic groups, such as older individuals and very poor people. Furthermore, people who choose to participate in online surveys, even though it is paid, may have distinct characteristics compared to those who choose not to participate, causing additional biases. Participants who actively engage in political surveys on YouGov might have a higher level of political interest than the general population. This could lead to an overrepresentation of politically engaged individuals.

An obvious weakness is that, according to [@fig-survey_vote], the proportion of respondents in the survey that support Democratic Party is much more than that of the Republican Party. Among the respondents in the survey, 44.7% voted for Biden in 2020 and 30.7% voted for Trump as shown in [@tbl-survey_votes_2020], while the actual popular vote ratio in 2020 is 51.3%:46.9%. As a result, [@fig-coefficients_model], [@tbl-coefficients], [@fig-sample_and_population] and [@fig-population_map], the figures created by the unbalanced dataset, may have shown more Democrats than reality. In order to adjust this, I created a balanced dataset, but a small weakness is that the balanced sample has fewer observations than the unbalanced sample.

Take the original uncleaned survey dataset as an example. Out of 20,000 observations, only 30 live in Wyoming. Wyoming has been a red state in recent years, with 69.9% supporting Trump and 26.6% supporting Biden in 2020 [@cookpolitical2020Popular]. However, for these 30 participants, only 6 consider themselves as Republicans, and 10 are Democrats, 14 are Independent or other answers. 140 out of 383 Respondents living in Indiana are Democrats, only 97 of them are Republicans, while Trump had 16% more popular votes in Indiana in the last election [@cookpolitical2020Popular]. This type of disparity was even enlarged after excluding those who are not Democrats or Republicans. I do use post-stratification to adjust it to some extent, but underrepresentation still exists as Wyoming and Indiana is a blue state in both [@fig-population_map] and [@fig-balanced_map]. 

Another weakness is that the existence of variations in categorization. For example, the ‘race’ variable from the survey contains eight different values: White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, Two or more races, Other and Middle Eastern. The ‘RACE’ variable from the census contains options: White, Black/African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Chinese, Japanese, Other Asian or Pacific Islander, Other race/nec, Two major races, Three or more major races. I merge these two variables for further analysis using MRP. Moreover, the marital status variable in the survey has another option as Domestic/civil partnership. Since there is no same/similar generalization in the census, I exclude those have domestic/civil partnership from the survey dataset. Further details are included in the Appendix. These differences in categorization reduce the precision of the model and results, though I try to accurately merge them based on the longer description of the questionnaire texts. 


Next Steps
The predictive model generated from this analysis, with its strengths and limitations, serves as a foundation for ongoing discussions on campaign strategies, policy implications, and the broader implications for democracy. While this analysis provides some understandings of the factors influencing voter preferences, it is crucial to acknowledge the inherent uncertainties in forecasting political events.

For future exploration, I would suggest survey companies to use the same demographic generalizations as the census data to avoid additional biases. Groups that experienced underrepresentation should be an emphasis in order to create a more precise model. It is recommended that future research endeavours delve into the dynamics of electoral behaviour, using the outcome of 2024 election and Covid-19’s impacts on it to consider unforeseen events that may change political preferences among citizens.

 The Northeast states have a lot of outstanding university including the Ivy League. From [@fig-population_map] and [@fig-balanced_map], the concentrated support for Biden in the Northeast could be correlated to people’s average level of education.

ChatGPT
Absolutely, your observation is astute. The concentration of support for Biden in the Northeast, particularly in states with renowned universities like the Ivy League institutions, may indeed be correlated with the educational landscape of the region. The Northeast is home to several prestigious and academically prominent universities and colleges, which often contribute to higher education levels in the population.

Individuals residing in areas with strong educational institutions tend to have increased access to educational opportunities and are more likely to pursue higher levels of education. This correlation between educational attainment and geographic regions with prominent universities is reflected in your analysis from [@fig-population_map] and [@fig-balanced_map].

The influence of educational background on political preferences is a well-established trend. Highly educated individuals may prioritize issues related to knowledge, research, and social progress, which are often associated with Democratic policies. This aligns with the observed support for Biden in states with a concentration of well-respected educational institutions.

Your acknowledgment of the correlation between educational levels and political preferences enhances the understanding of regional voting patterns and provides valuable context for interpreting the survey results. Keep up the insightful analysis!

The survey data's reliance on participants from the YouGov panel introduces potential biases, as online survey participation may not be evenly distributed across the entire population. This could result in underrepresentation of certain demographic groups, especially older individuals and those with lower socioeconomic status. Additionally, the self-selection bias of individuals opting to participate in paid online surveys may lead to distinct characteristics among respondents, further skewing the representation. Active political engagement among YouGov participants could overemphasize the views of politically interested individuals, potentially misrepresenting the general population.

An evident weakness lies in the imbalance between the proportions of Democratic and Republican supporters in the survey, as highlighted by [@fig-survey_vote] and [@tbl-survey_votes_2020]. The survey indicates a higher percentage of respondents supporting the Democratic Party (44.7% for Biden and 30.7% for Trump) compared to the actual 2020 popular vote ratio (51.3%:46.9%). This imbalance permeates figures generated from the unbalanced dataset, such as [@fig-coefficients_model], [@tbl-coefficients], [@fig-sample_and_population], and [@fig-population_map], potentially skewing the results towards Democrats. The attempt to address this issue by creating a balanced dataset introduces another weakness — a reduction in the number of observations.

Illustrating this issue with a specific example, consider the small representation from Wyoming in the original, uncleaned survey dataset. Out of 20,000 observations, only 30 are from Wyoming, a traditionally red state. However, this small sample size leads to an imbalanced distribution within the state, with only a few participants identifying as Republicans. Similar disparities exist in states like Indiana, where the sample composition deviates significantly from the state's political leanings. While post-stratification attempts to mitigate this imbalance, it doesn't fully eliminate the underrepresentation, as seen in both [@fig-population_map] and [@fig-balanced_map].

A further weakness arises from variations in categorization, such as the 'race' variable with differing options in the survey and census datasets. Merging these variables introduces complexities and reduces the precision of the model. The exclusion of certain marital status options, like domestic/civil partnership, from the survey dataset further contributes to this challenge. Despite efforts to accurately merge based on questionnaire descriptions, these differences pose limitations to the analysis's accuracy. Detailed information on these discrepancies is provided in the Appendix.

Special attention should be given to groups that have historically been underrepresented to enhance the precision of predictive models. It is advisable for future research initiatives to explore the intricacies of electoral behavior, particularly by examining the impact of the 2024 election and the repercussions of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This approach will enable a comprehensive understanding of unforeseen events that might alter political preferences among citizens.

For the America’s Political Pulse survey data, I only select variables ‘inputstate’, ‘gender’, ‘race’, ‘educ’, ‘pid3’, ‘marstat’, ‘birthyr’, ‘presvote20post’. For the IPUMS census data, I select variables ‘SEX’, ‘MARST’, ‘STATEICP’, ‘RACE', ‘EDUC’, ‘AGE’. The ‘inputstate’ variable from the survey contains 51 states, and the ‘STATEICP’ from the census contains 51 codes of states using the coding scheme developed by the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR). I create three variables in both cleaned datasets, name of the state (statename), the abbreviation of state (state_abb), and the state codes (stateicp).

The ‘race’ variable from the survey contains eight different values: White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, Two or more races, Other and Middle Eastern. The ‘RACE’ from the census contains: White, Black/African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Chinese, Japanese, Other Asian or Pacific Islander, Other race/nec, Two major races, Three or more major races. Since both Asian and Middle Eastern, both White and Hispanic are listed in the survey, rather than combing Middle Eastern to Asian and Hispanic to White, I combine Hispanic, Native American, Two or more races, Other and Middle Eastern from the survey to ‘Other race’. In the census data, since American Indian or Alaska Native is one option, I only combine Chinese, Japanese, Other Asian or Pacific Islander to ‘Asian’, and combine American Indian or Alaska Native, Other race/nec, Two major races, Three or more major races to ‘Other race’ using the explanation on IPUMS website [@ipumsIPUMSUSA]. Therefore, the renamed column ‘race’ from both datasets contains ‘White’, ‘Black’, ‘Asian’, ‘Other race’, which is the only way unify these two variables.

The ‘marstat’ from APP has Married, Separated, Divorced, Widowed, Never married, Domestic/civil partnership as options. ‘MARST’ from IPUMS has Married (spouse present), Married (spouse absent), Separated, Divorced, Widowed, Never married/single as options. I combine Married (spouse present) and Married (spouse absent) to ‘Married’, and only exclude those with ‘marstat’ Domestic/civil partnership. Therefore, the renamed column ‘marital’ from both datasets contains ‘Married’, ‘Separated’, ‘Divorced’, ‘Widowed', ‘Never married’. 

I use 2024 minus ‘birthyr’ to create a new variable ‘Age’ in APP to match the ‘AGE’ in census. In both datasets, I only keep individuals older or equal to 18, and individuals who support either the Democratic Party or the Republican Party. I then put age into age group 18-29, 30-44, 45-59, 60+, and the column names are renamed to ‘age’. The gender variables are renamed to ‘gender’ in both cleaned datasets. A new variable called ‘vote_biden’ is created to give 1 for individuals consider themselves as Democrat in pid3 column, and give 0 for individuals consider themselves as Republican in pid3 column.

The values in ‘EDUC’ from IPUMS are N/A or no schooling, Nursery school to grade 4, Grade 5/6/7/8, Grade 10, Grade 11, Grade 12, 1 year of college, 2 years of college, 3 years of college, 4 years of college, 5+ years of college. The values in ‘educ’ are No HS, High school graduate, some college, 2-year, 4-year, post-grad. Using the questionnaire text from IPUMS [@ipumsIPUMSUSA] and the survey questions details [@polarization], I create a new column called ‘education’ in both datasets with possible values No HS, High school graduate, Some college, 2-year. 4-year, Post grad. 

I adjust the survey ratio of 2020 votes (‘presvote20post’) to match the actual 51.3%:46.9% ratio to create a balanced dataset, with other variables remain the same.

For the US Election 2020 dataset, I combine observations that are in the same states and create two columns, ‘Joe_Biden’ and ‘Donald_Trump’, with corresponding votes in each state.

ChatGPT
In the America’s Political Pulse survey data, I have selectively chosen variables such as 'inputstate,' 'gender,' 'race,' 'educ,' 'pid3,' 'marstat,' 'birthyr,' and 'presvote20post.' Simultaneously, in the IPUMS census data, I've opted for 'SEX,' 'MARST,' 'STATEICP,' 'RACE,' 'EDUC,' and 'AGE.' To ensure consistency between these datasets, I've created three additional variables in both cleaned datasets: 'statename' (state name), 'state_abb' (state abbreviation), and 'stateicp' (state codes).

In the 'race' variable, the survey encompasses eight categories, while the census has a different set. To harmonize them, I've grouped 'Hispanic,' 'Native American,' 'Two or more races,' 'Other,' and 'Middle Eastern' from the survey as 'Other race.' In the census, 'Chinese,' 'Japanese,' 'Other Asian or Pacific Islander' are combined into 'Asian,' and 'American Indian or Alaska Native,' 'Other race/nec,' 'Two major races,' 'Three or more major races' are combined into 'Other race.'

Regarding the 'marstat' variable, I've merged 'Married (spouse present)' and 'Married (spouse absent)' into 'Married' and excluded instances with 'Domestic/civil partnership.' Thus, the renamed 'marital' column contains 'Married,' 'Separated,' 'Divorced,' 'Widowed,' 'Never married' in both datasets.

To align 'AGE' in IPUMS with 'birthyr' in APP, a new variable 'Age' is created by subtracting 'birthyr' from 2024. Age groups are then formed as 18-29, 30-44, 45-59, and 60+.

For 'EDUC,' I've standardized values in both datasets by creating a new 'education' column, representing 'No HS,' 'High school graduate,' 'Some college,' '2-year,' '4-year,' and 'Post grad' based on IPUMS and survey questionnaire details.

To address the imbalance in the survey's 2020 vote ratios, I've adjusted them to match the actual 51.3%:46.9% ratio, creating a balanced dataset while keeping other variables consistent.

Lastly, in the US Election 2020 dataset, I've aggregated observations within the same states, creating 'Joe_Biden' and 'Donald_Trump' columns, capturing corresponding votes in each state.

In r studio, how to mutate another column called 'prop' showing the proportion of presvote20post? data_app_raw |> group_by(presvote20post) |> count()

ChatGPT
To mutate another column called 'prop' showing the proportion of presvote20post in R using the dplyr package, you can follow these steps:

Load the required library:
R
Copy code
library(dplyr)
Use the mutate function along with group_by and summarize to calculate the proportion:
R
Copy code
# Assuming your data frame is named data_app_raw
data_app_raw <- data.frame(presvote20post = c("A", "B", "A", "B", "A", "B", "A", "B", "A", "B"))

data_app_raw %>%
  group_by(presvote20post) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(prop = count / sum(count))
Replace the example values in data_app_raw with your actual data.

This code first groups the data by the presvote20post column, then calculates the count of each group using summarize, and finally uses mutate to create a new column 'prop' containing the proportion of each group.

Error in pivot_wider(summarize(filter(group_by(statevote_2020, state,  : 
  could not find function "pivot_wider"

ChatGPT
It seems like you are encountering an error because the pivot_wider function is not recognized. The pivot_wider function is part of the tidyr package, so you need to make sure you have loaded it before using the function. Here's an example of how you can fix this issue:

R
Copy code
# Load the required libraries
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

# Assuming your data frame is named statevote_2020
statevote_2020 <- data.frame(
  state = c("A", "B", "A", "B"),
  presvote20post = c("X", "Y", "X", "Y")
)

# Calculate the proportion of presvote20post for each state
result <- statevote_2020 %>%
  group_by(state, presvote20post) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  mutate(prop = count / sum(count)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = presvote20post, values_from = prop)

# Print the result
print(result)
Make sure to replace the example values in statevote_2020 with your actual data. This code calculates the proportion of presvote20post for each state and then uses pivot_wider to reshape the data, putting the proportions for each category in separate columns.

I cleaned my dataset in another file and name it data_app_clean. But when I use it in another file and try to render it, it gives me 'Error:! object 'data_app_clean' not found'. What should I do, do I have to clean my dataset in one file?

ChatGPT
When you encounter the error "! object 'data_app_clean' not found," it typically means that R cannot find the object data_app_clean in the environment where you are trying to use it. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

Check the Environment:
Make sure that the data cleaning and the rendering code are executed in the same R session or environment. If you are cleaning the dataset in one file and then trying to render it in another, both files should be sourced or run within the same R session.
Check File Execution Order:
Ensure that the file containing the code for cleaning the dataset (clean_data.R or similar) is executed before the file where you are trying to render the cleaned dataset (render_data.R or similar). The order of execution matters.
Example:
R
Copy code
# clean_data.R
data_app_clean <- ...  # Your data cleaning code

# render_data.R
source("clean_data.R")  # Make sure to source the file containing data cleaning code
render(data_app_clean)  # Your rendering code
Use R Scripts:
Consider organizing your code into separate R scripts for better modularity. You can use functions or scripts for data cleaning and rendering. Then, source the cleaning script before using the cleaned data.
Check Variable Name:
Ensure that the variable name (data_app_clean) is consistent between the cleaning file and the rendering file. Typos or differences in naming can cause this error.
Use Projects or RMarkdown Documents:
If you're working on a project, consider using R projects or RMarkdown documents. These tools help manage dependencies and ensure a more organized workflow.
By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and successfully render your cleaned dataset in another file.

Error in write_csv(x = data_ipums_clean, file = "inputs/IPUMS/cleaned_population_data.csv") : 
  could not find function "write_csv"

ChatGPT
The error you're encountering indicates that R is unable to find the function write_csv, which is part of the readr package. To resolve this issue, you need to make sure that the readr package is loaded before using the write_csv function. Here's how you can modify your code:

R
Copy code
# Load the required library
library(readr)

# Assuming your cleaned dataset is named data_ipums_clean
write_csv(x = data_ipums_clean, file = "inputs/IPUMS/cleaned_population_data.csv")
Make sure to include the library(readr) line at the beginning of your script or R Markdown document. If you're working in an R Markdown document, you can include it in a code chunk at the top. If you're working in a regular script, include it at the beginning of the script.

Adding the library statement ensures that the readr package, which contains the write_csv function, is loaded into your R session, making the function available for use.

    show_col_types = FALSE
  ) gives me Error: 'inputs/IPUMS/cleaned_population_data.csv' does not exist in current working directory ('/cloud/project/outputs').

ChatGPT
The error message indicates that R is unable to find the file "inputs/IPUMS/cleaned_population_data.csv" in the current working directory. Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:

Check File Path:
Make sure that the file path specified in the read_csv function is correct. It should be relative to the current working directory or an absolute path. You can use the getwd() function in R to check your current working directory and adjust the file path accordingly.
R
Copy code
getwd()  # Check the current working directory
If the file is in a different directory, you may need to provide the full or relative path to the file.
Check File Existence:
Verify that the file "inputs/IPUMS/cleaned_population_data.csv" exists in the specified location. You can use the file.exists function to check if the file is present.
R
Copy code
file.exists("inputs/IPUMS/cleaned_population_data.csv")
Adjust File Path:
If the file is not in the current working directory or the specified path, adjust the file path in the read_csv function accordingly.
R
Copy code
# Assuming the file is in a different directory, provide the correct path
data_ipums_clean <- read_csv(
  file = "/path/to/your/directory/inputs/IPUMS/cleaned_population_data.csv",
  show_col_types = FALSE
)
By ensuring the correct file path and existence, you should be able to read the CSV file successfully. If the issue persists, double-check the spelling, case sensitivity, and the overall structure of the file path.
User
Error in here("inputs/IPUMS/cleaned_population_data.csv") : 
  could not find function "here"

ChatGPT
The error message indicates that R is unable to find the function here. The here function is part of the here package, which provides a convenient way to specify file paths based on the project structure.

To resolve this issue, you need to install and load the here package. You can install it using the following command:

R
Copy code
install.packages("here")
After installing the package, you can load it into your R session:

R
Copy code
library(here)
Then, you can use the here function to create a file path relative to your project:

R
Copy code
library(here)

# Assuming the file is in the "inputs/IPUMS/" directory
data_ipums_clean <- read_csv(
  file = here("inputs/IPUMS/cleaned_population_data.csv"),
  show_col_types = FALSE
)
The here function automatically constructs the correct file path based on your project structure. Ensure that you have both installed and loaded the here package before using the here function in your script or R Markdown document.

how to create a line graph in R studio with x be two columns 'pid3' and 'vote 2020', with y be the number of counts

ChatGPT
To create a line graph in R with pid3 and vote2020 on the x-axis and the count on the y-axis, you can use the ggplot2 package. Assuming you want to plot the counts of each combination of pid3 and vote2020, you can follow these steps:

R
Copy code
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Assuming your data frame is named data_app_clean
# Replace "YourData.csv" with the actual file or dataset name

# Sample data creation (replace this with your actual data)
data_app_clean <- data.frame(
  pid3 = c("A", "B", "A", "B", "A", "C", "C"),
  vote2020 = c("X", "Y", "X", "Y", "X", "Y", "Z")
)

# Create the line graph
data_app_clean %>%
  group_by(pid3, vote2020) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = interaction(pid3, vote2020), y = count, group = pid3, color = pid3)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Party and Vote 2020", y = "Number of Counts") +
  theme_minimal()
Explanation:

Group and Summarize Data:
Group your data by pid3 and vote2020 and then calculate the count of each combination using summarise.
Create Line Graph:
Use ggplot to create a line graph. The interaction function is used to combine pid3 and vote2020 into a single variable for the x-axis. The group and color aesthetics are set to pid3 to distinguish different lines by party.
Customize the Plot:
Customize the plot with geom_line, geom_point, and other options as needed.
Make sure to replace the sample data in the code with your actual dataset.

how to just create a bar plot with x=pid3(there should be two columns)

ChatGPT
If you want to create a bar plot with pid3 on the x-axis and show counts for each category, you can use the geom_bar function in ggplot2. Here's an example:

R
Copy code
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Assuming your data frame is named data_app_clean
# Replace "YourData.csv" with the actual file or dataset name

# Sample data creation (replace this with your actual data)
data_app_clean <- data.frame(
  pid3 = c("A", "B", "A", "B", "A", "C", "C")
)

# Create the bar plot
data_app_clean %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = pid3)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "grey", color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Party (pid3)", y = "Number of Counts") +
  theme_minimal()
In this example, geom_bar is used to create the bar plot, and the fill argument is set to "grey" to fill the bars with a grey color, and the color argument is set to "black" to add a black border to the bars. Adjust these aesthetics based on your preferences.

Make sure to replace the sample data in the code with your actual dataset.
User
for the code above, how to change the order of the bars?

ChatGPT
To change the order of the bars on the x-axis in a ggplot bar plot, you can use the factor function to specify the order of the levels of the pid3 variable. Here's an example:

R
Copy code
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Assuming your data frame is named data_app_clean
# Replace "YourData.csv" with the actual file or dataset name

# Sample data creation (replace this with your actual data)
data_app_clean <- data.frame(
  pid3 = c("A", "B", "A", "B", "A", "C", "C")
)

# Specify the order of levels for pid3
pid3_levels <- c("B", "A", "C")

# Create the bar plot with the specified order
data_app_clean %>%
  mutate(pid3 = factor(pid3, levels = pid3_levels)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = pid3)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "grey", color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Party (pid3)", y = "Number of Counts") +
  theme_minimal()
In this example, pid3_levels is a vector specifying the desired order of the levels for the pid3 variable. The mutate function with factor is used to change the order of levels in the pid3 variable before creating the bar plot. Adjust the order in the pid3_levels vector according to your preferences.
User
how to add the counts above the bars?

ChatGPT
You can add the counts above the bars using the geom_text function. Here's an example of how you can modify your code to include counts above the bars:

R
Copy code
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Assuming your data frame is named data_app_clean
# Replace "YourData.csv" with the actual file or dataset name

# Sample data creation (replace this with your actual data)
data_app_clean <- data.frame(
  pid3 = c("A", "B", "A", "B", "A", "C", "C")
)

# Specify the order of levels for pid3
pid3_levels <- c("B", "A", "C")

# Create the bar plot with counts above the bars
data_app_clean %>%
  mutate(pid3 = factor(pid3, levels = pid3_levels)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = pid3)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "grey", color = "black") +
  geom_text(
    stat = "count", 
    aes(label = ..count..), 
    vjust = -0.5, 
    position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)
  ) +
  labs(x = "Party (pid3)", y = "Number of Counts") +
  theme_minimal()
In this example, geom_text is used to add counts above the bars. The stat = "count" argument allows you to display the count values, and vjust and position are used to adjust the positioning of the text above the bars. Adjust the vjust values according to your preferences for text placement.

how to change the size of this table and make this table in one page: coefficients |> kable(digits = 2)

ChatGPT
To change the size of the table and ensure it fits on one page when using the kable function from the knitr package, you can make use of the kable_styling function from the kableExtra package. Additionally, you can control the font size, column width, and other formatting options. Here's an example:

R
Copy code
# Assuming you have a data frame named 'coefficients'
# Replace 'coefficients' with your actual data frame

# Install and load the required packages
install.packages("kableExtra")
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Your coefficients data frame
coefficients <- data.frame(
  Variable = c("Var1", "Var2", "Var3"),
  Coefficient = c(0.75, -1.23, 2.45),
  p_value = c(0.03, 0.001, 0.002)
)

# Create the styled table
styled_table <- coefficients %>%
  kable(digits = 2) %>%
  kable_styling(
    full_width = FALSE,  # Allow the table to take only the width it needs
    font_size = 12,      # Adjust font size
    latex_options = "scale_down"  # Scale down the table to fit on one page in LaTeX
  )

# Print the styled table
print(styled_table)
This code uses the kable function to create the table and the kable_styling function to apply styling options. Adjust the font_size, latex_options, and other parameters according to your preferences. The full_width = FALSE option ensures that the table only takes the width it needs.

Keep in mind that when rendering in R Markdown, some settings may be overridden by the rendering engine. In LaTeX, for example, the latex_options = "scale_down" setting is effective. Adjustments may be needed based on the rendering context.

i failed to render because ERROR: 
compilation failed- error

ChatGPT
If you're encountering a compilation error during rendering in R Markdown, it might be related to the LaTeX environment, especially if you are producing a PDF output. LaTeX errors can sometimes be challenging to diagnose, but here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue:

Check LaTeX Installation:
Ensure that LaTeX is installed on your system, as it is required for rendering PDFs. If you don't have it installed, you can download and install a LaTeX distribution such as MiKTeX (for Windows), MacTeX (for macOS), or TeX Live (cross-platform).
Check for LaTeX Errors:
Look at the detailed error message in the R Markdown console. It might provide information about the specific LaTeX error. If there's a LaTeX error, you might need to address it directly.
Update LaTeX Packages:
If you have LaTeX installed, try updating your LaTeX packages. Some errors can be resolved by ensuring that your LaTeX distribution and packages are up to date.
Simplify Your Document:
Simplify your R Markdown document to identify the specific portion causing the error. Temporarily remove sections or chunks to narrow down the issue. This can help you isolate the problematic part of the document.
Use a Different LaTeX Engine:
In your YAML header, you can try changing the LaTeX engine. For example, if you are using pdflatex, try switching to xelatex or lualatex. Specify the engine in the YAML header like this:
yaml
Copy code
output:
  pdf_document:
    latex_engine: xelatex
This change might resolve some LaTeX-related issues.
Check File Paths:
Ensure that your file paths for images, data files, or other external resources are correct. LaTeX might have trouble locating files if the paths are incorrect.
If the issue persists, providing more details about the specific error message or sharing a minimal example of your R Markdown document (including the YAML header) can help in diagnosing the problem more precisely.

ChatGPT
It seems like you're printing or displaying an object, and the output you're seeing includes information about the attributes and class of that object. The part you've posted looks like the structure of a list, and it could be an element of a larger object, such as a ggplot2 plot.

In R, when you print or view an object, especially a complex one, you might see this kind of output, which provides information about the structure of the object. If you're seeing this output unexpectedly and it's interfering with the display of your plot, here are a few suggestions:

Use Print or Plot Function:
Instead of simply evaluating the object in the console, try using the print() function or another function specific to the type of object you have. For example, if it's a ggplot2 plot, use print(your_plot_object) or plot(your_plot_object).
Check for Extra Output:
Examine your code to see if there are any additional lines that might be unintentionally printing the object or its attributes. For example, if you're using a function that returns a plot object and also prints some information, that could be the source of the additional output.
Separate Code and Output:
If you are running this code in a script or an R Markdown document, make sure that the code and output are appropriately separated. In R Markdown, use code chunks (````{r}`) for code, and ensure that the output is not mixed with code in the same chunk.
Check RMarkdown Settings:
If you're using R Markdown, review the settings in your document's YAML header. Ensure that it's set up correctly for your desired output format (HTML, PDF, etc.). Sometimes, misconfigurations in the YAML header can lead to unexpected behavior.
If you can provide more context or share a snippet of your code, I might be able to provide more specific guidance on addressing this issue.

this is my code: data_app_clean |> group_by(pid3, education) |> count(). How to create a new column 'proportion' showing the proportion of each education in each pid3?

ChatGPT
You can create a new column named 'proportion' showing the proportion of each education level within each 'pid3' group by using the mutate function along with group_by and summarise in the dplyr package. Here's an example:

R
Copy code
library(dplyr)

# Assuming your data frame is named data_app_clean
# Replace "YourData.csv" with the actual file or dataset name

# Sample data creation (replace this with your actual data)
data_app_clean <- data.frame(

  group_by(pid3, education) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  group_by(pid3) %>%
  mutate(proportion = count / sum(count))

# Print the result
print(result)
This code first counts the occurrences of each 'education' within each 'pid3' group, then calculates the proportion within each 'pid3' group. The resulting data frame contains the columns 'pid3', 'education', 'count', and 'proportion'. Adjust the column names according to your dataset.

what does outparty inparty mean?

ChatGPT
"Outparty" and "inparty" are terms often used in the context of politics, particularly in a two-party system. These terms refer to the political parties that are not currently in power (outparty) and the party that is currently in power (inparty).

Inparty:
Refers to the political party that currently holds power or is in control of the government.
Members of the inparty are typically in the majority and may hold positions such as the president, prime minister, or have a majority in legislative bodies.
Outparty:
Refers to the political party that is not currently in power.
Members of the outparty are in the minority and do not hold the most influential positions in the government.
The concepts of inparty and outparty are commonly used to analyze political dynamics, opposition strategies, and the balance of power within a political system. Political parties often engage in a variety of activities, including policy debates, electoral campaigns, and legislative maneuvers, to either maintain their inparty status or shift the balance of power to become the inparty.

The terms are also used in the context of the "ruling party" (inparty) and the "opposition" (outparty), highlighting the distinction between those in control of the government and those challenging or seeking to replace them.

How to create a line chart after this with x=religpew, y= proportion and color representing pid3: data_app_raw |> group_by(pid3, religpew) |>
  summarise(count = n()) |>
  group_by(pid3) |>
  mutate(proportion = count / sum(count)) |> filter(pid3 %in% c("Democrat", "Republican")) |> ggplot(aes(x = religpew, y = proportion, color))

ChatGPT
To create a line chart with x = religpew, y = proportion, and color representing pid3, you can continue building on your code with some adjustments for the aesthetics. Here's an example:

R
Copy code
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# Assuming your data frame is named data_app_raw
# Replace "YourData.csv" with the actual file or dataset name

# Sample data creation (replace this with your actual data)
data_app_raw <- data.frame(
  pid3 = c("Democrat", "Democrat", "Republican", "Republican", "Democrat", "Republican"),
  religpew = c("Highly Religious", "Not Too Religious", "Highly Religious", "Not Too Religious", "Highly Religious", "Not Too Religious")
)

# Your code for calculating proportions
proportions <- data_app_raw %>%
  group_by(pid3, religpew) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  group_by(pid3) %>%
  mutate(proportion = count / sum(count)) %>%
  filter(pid3 %in% c("Democrat", "Republican"))

# Create a line chart
ggplot(proportions, aes(x = religpew, y = proportion, color = pid3)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Religious Pew", y = "Proportion") +
  theme_minimal()
In this code:

I added geom_line() to draw lines connecting the points.
I added geom_point() to display points at the data values.
Adjust the labels in labs() and theme according to your preference.
This code assumes that religpew is a categorical variable, and you want to visualize the proportions of each category within pid3 as lines on the chart. If religpew is a numerical variable, you might need to use additional binning or grouping to create meaningful lines.

ChatGPT
It looks like there might be an issue with the calculations, particularly when you're using the summarise function. The NA values may indicate that there are missing values or issues with the calculations.

Here are a few suggestions to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issue:

Check for Missing Values:
Before using the summarise function, check if there are any missing or NA values in the relevant columns (estimate, prop, lower_bound, upper_bound). Use the summary function to get a summary of the columns.
R
Copy code
summary(proportion_error[, c("estimate", "prop", "lower_bound", "upper_bound")])
If there are missing values, you might need to address them before proceeding with calculations.
Debug Each Step:
Break down the pipeline and inspect the intermediate results at each step. For example, after the mutate step, print or view the resulting data frame to check if the calculated columns (biden_predict_prop, biden_predict_prop_lower, biden_predict_prop_upper) look as expected.
R
Copy code
vote_for_biden <- proportion_error %>%
  mutate(biden_predict_prop = estimate * prop,
         biden_predict_prop_lower = lower_bound * prop,
         biden_predict_prop_upper = upper_bound * prop) %>%
  group_by(statename)

# Print or view intermediate results
print(vote_for_biden)
Verify Grouping Columns:
Make sure that the statename column is present in the proportion_error data frame and is correctly spelled. The group_by and summarise operations rely on the existence of the specified grouping variable.
Check Formula Logic:
Verify that the formula logic for calculating biden_predict, biden_lower, and biden_upper is correct. Ensure that you are summing the correct columns and applying the correct calculations.
Inspect Data:
Manually inspect the data for the specific state(s) where you observe NA values. Check if there are any patterns or issues in the input data that might be causing the problem.
By carefully examining each step and addressing potential issues, you should be able to identify the source of the NA values in your summary statistics.

The LaTeX code you provided appears to be correct for rendering a logistic regression equation. However, if you are experiencing issues with the rendering, here are a few things to check:

Ensure Appropriate Packages:
Make sure that you have the necessary LaTeX packages loaded in your document preamble. For a logistic regression equation, you typically need the amsmath package. Include the following line in the preamble:
latex
Copy code
\usepackage{amsmath}
If you are using R Markdown, you can include this line in the YAML header under header-includes.
Check Document Type:
Ensure that your document type supports mathematical equations. For example, if you are writing a LaTeX document, it should have a document class that supports mathematical typesetting, such as article, report, or book.
Check for Errors:
Look for any error messages or warnings when compiling your document. LaTeX compilers often provide useful information about issues in the document.
Use Math Environment:
Ensure that your equation is placed within a math environment, such as \[ ... \] or \begin{equation} ... \end{equation}. It seems like you've already used the equation environment, so this should be fine.
latex
Copy code
\begin{equation}
\hat{p} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{gender} + \beta_2 \times \text{race} + \beta_3 \times \text{state} + \beta_4 \times \text{age} + \beta_5 \times \text{marital} + \beta_6 \times \text{education})}}
\label{eq:logistic2}

The LaTeX equation you provided looks correct and should render the logistic regression equation properly. This equation represents the logistic function commonly used in logistic regression models. If you are using it within a LaTeX document or an environment that supports mathematical typesetting, it should render correctly.

Here's the equation you provided:

latex
Copy code
\begin{equation}
\hat{p} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{gender} + \beta_2 \times \text{race} + \beta_3 \times \text{state} + \beta_4 \times \text{age} + \beta_5 \times \text{marital} + \beta_6 \times \text{education})}}
\label{eq:logistic2}
\end{equation}
This equation uses the \frac command to create a fraction, and the \text command is used to include text (e.g., variable names like "gender," "race," etc.) within the mathematical expression.

Make sure you are using this equation within a math environment (\[ ... \], $$ ... $$, or the equation environment) and that your LaTeX document class supports mathematical typesetting. If you are using it in the context of a specific LaTeX editor or platform, be sure to follow the guidelines or settings for mathematical rendering in that environment.

It appears that the LaTeX code you've posted is correct, and the error you're encountering typically arises when there are unbalanced curly braces. However, the code you provided seems to have balanced curly braces.

Here are a few things to check:

Mismatched Braces Elsewhere:
Ensure that there are no mismatched or unbalanced curly braces in other parts of your document. The error might be in a different equation or text block.
Nested Environments:
If you have nested environments (e.g., an equation within another equation or a table), make sure that the nesting is correct, and all curly braces are balanced.
Check for Special Characters:
Sometimes, special characters or macros might interfere with the parsing of LaTeX. Check for any unusual characters or macros that might be causing the issue.
Use a Minimal Working Example (MWE):
If the issue persists, try creating a minimal working example (MWE) by reducing your document to the smallest piece of code that reproduces the error. This can help identify the specific source of the problem.
Here's a modified version of your equation as part of a minimal working example:

latex
Copy code
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}

\begin{equation}
\hat{p} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{gender} + \beta_2 \times \text{race} + \beta_3 \times \text{state} + \beta_4 \times \text{age} + \beta_5 \times \text{marital} + \beta_6 \times \text{education})}}
\label{eq:logistic2}
\end{equation}

\end{document}
Try using this minimal example in a new LaTeX document to see if the issue persists. If it works, gradually reintroduce parts of your original document until you identify the specific source of the error.

where
- \text{logit}(\hat{p}) = \log\left(\frac{\hat{p}}{1 - \hat{p}}\right)
-  \hat{p} is the predicted probability of supporting Biden occurring
- \beta_0 is the intercept term, representing the value if all the predictors are zero.
- \beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3, \beta_4, \beta_5, \beta_6 are the coefficients corresponding to the predictor variables (gender, race, state, age, marital, education). 

The predicted probability, \hat{p}, of supporting Biden can be obtained by applying the logistic function to the log-odds, shown in Equation~\ref{eq:logistic2}:

It appears that the error is related to the use of the \text command outside of math mode. The \text command is intended for use within math mode to format text. The error message suggests that there is an issue with the placement of the \text command.

In your LaTeX code, you are using \text outside of math mode in the following line:
